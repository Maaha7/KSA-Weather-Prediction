# KSA-Weather-Prediction
## In this notebook:
Acquired and cleaned KSA weather dataset from Kaggle. 
Handled missing values, and standardized data formats. 
Performed feature normalization to put all predictors on a similar scale. 
Engineered new features to improve temperature prediction. 
Developed a linear regression model to forecast temperature. 
Evaluated model performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics on a held-out test set.
